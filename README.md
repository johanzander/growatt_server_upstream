# Growatt Server Upstream

[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]
[![hacs][hacsbadge]][hacs]

Upstream development version of the Growatt Server integration for Home Assistant.

## About

This repository serves as an **upstream testing ground** for improvements to the Growatt Server integration before they are submitted to Home Assistant Core.

## Features (v2.1.0)

**Base Version**: Home Assistant Core 2025.9.0 Growatt Server integration

**Changes from Base Version**:

1. `manifest.json` updated for custom component distribution
2. [API Token authentication support][pr-149783] - Official V1 API supporting [MIN and SPH inverters][growatt-device-types]
3. [Inverter control][pr-153468] - Number and switch entities for controlling inverter settings
4. Read / write Time Of Use (TOU) settings using service calls:
  `growattserver.read_time_segments,
  growattserver.update_time_segment`
5. Adds 5 min rate limit to login to prevent account locking - aims to fix [account locking issue][issue-150732]
6. **Fixed sensor naming issue** - Sensors now display proper translated names instead of generic device class names
7. **Fixed timezone handling in API throttling** - Fixed bug that could cause very long throttling times (500 minutes)
8. **Enhanced TLX sensor coverage** - Added 14 new sensors for power and energy
monitoring
9. **Custom growattServer library** - Uses custom [branch][growatt-lib-cleanup] library adding support for SPH/MIX inverter

### Inverter Control Features (V1 API)

When using token authentication (supports [MIN and SPH inverters][growatt-device-types]), you get:

**Number Entities** (0-100%):

- Charge power
- Charge stop SOC
- Discharge power
- Discharge stop SOC

**Switch Entities**:

- AC charge enable/disable

All control entities provide real-time feedback and proper error handling.

### Enhanced MIN Sensor Coverage (v1.4.6)

Added 14 new sensors for power and energy monitoring:

**Power Flow Monitoring**:

- Solar generation today
- Local load power, import power, export power
- System power, self power

**Energy Accounting**:

- System production (today/total)
- Self-consumption (today/total)
- Grid import/export (today/total)
- Battery charging from grid (today/total)

These sensors provide complete visibility into energy flows and system performance for MIN inverters.

## Installation

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Create feature branch, implement changes, test thoroughly, submit PR. All contributions considered for submission back to Home Assistant Core.

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for troubleshooting issues, add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.growatt_server: debug
```

After adding this configuration:
